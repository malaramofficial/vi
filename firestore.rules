/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Smart Line Timer application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles, devices, and timer data.
 * Power events are publicly readable but can only be created by authenticated devices.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 * - /users/{userId}/devices/{deviceId}: Stores device information associated with a user.
 * - /users/{userId}/timerData/{timerDataId}: Stores timer settings and state for each user.
 * - /power_events/{powerEventId}: Logs power on/off events from devices.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own user profiles, devices, and timer data.
 * - Power events are publicly listable to enable trending and reporting, but creation is restricted to authenticated users.
 * - Device ownership is validated by the `deviceId` on the User record.
 * - Listing of all users is disallowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - User ID is included in TimerData documents to allow direct ownership checks without needing to `get()` the user document.
 * - Device ID is present on the User record to allow validation of power event creation without needing to `get()` the device document.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Power events are stored in a top-level collection to facilitate public listing and aggregation for trending analysis.
